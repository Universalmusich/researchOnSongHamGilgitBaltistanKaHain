When it comes to cultural expression, music has always been a potent tool for building narratives, expressing emotions, and spurring change. Regarding Gilgit-Baltistan, an area encircled by Pakistan's magnificent mountains, music has been crucial in forming the identity and cohesion of its populace. The daily lives of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan are intricately linked to music.

Overall, music in Gilgit-Baltistan is not just entertainment but a vital aspect of cultural identity and expression.
Looking at the immense importance of music in Gilgit-Baltistan, Zafar Waqar Taj used it to alleviate the identity crisis prevalent in Gilgit-Baltistan. People of Gilgit-Baltistan have always faced identity crisis due to its complex history, cultural diversity, and political disputes. The region has been part of various empires and dynasties, including the British Raj, Dogra’s, and the region is in the middle of different empires due to which it has been influenced by different cultures, including Tibetan, central Asian, Chinese, and Pakistani. This has resulted in a blend of cultures, languages, and religions, making it challenging for the people of Gilgit-Baltistan to define their identity. The political status of the area has also not been discussed since Pakistan's independence; some have campaigned for independence, while others favor province status. The inhabitants of Gilgit-Baltistan are experiencing an identity crisis as a result of this ambiguity, which is making it more difficult for them to declare their unique political and cultural identities. Nevertheless, amid this perplexing situation, the song "Ham Gilgit-Baltistan k Hain" emerged as a ray of hope, helping the people of Gilgit-Baltistan embrace and accept who they are as "Gilgit-Baltistanis"

However, this song made me realize that, despite our differences, all Gilgit-Baltistanis are from the same tribe, and it altered the way I perceived them.
As I delved deeper into the lyrics, I discovered that the song was not just about unity but also about identity. The verse "ہم بیٹے ہیں کوہساروں کے برفیلے مست نظاروں کے" (We are the sons of the snow-capped mountains and majestic views) made me realize that our region's breathtaking natural beauty is not just a sight to behold but an integral part of who we are. It emphasizes that the majestic mountains and serene landscapes are woven into the fabric of our identity, defining us as people connected deeply to our environment and these wonderful mountains.
The lyrics "ہم بمائی جہاں کا باسی ہیں ہمسایہ چاند ستاروں کے" (We are the inhabitants of the land of paradise, neighboring the moon and stars) further reinforced this idea, reminds me that Gilgit-Baltistan is not just a place on a map, but it is a piece paradise on earth. This verse instills a sense of pride and gratitude, highlighting the unique beauty of our homeland and our fortune to be its custodians. 
The song also highlights the importance of our cultural heritage. The lyrics "وارث غیور ثقافت کے”  (We are the inheritors of a proud culture,) reminded me that our culture is our strength. The importance of maintaining our traditions for upcoming generations is emphasized in this poetry. It illustrates our pride in and dedication to preserving our cultural heritage. 
The verse "ہم مالک ملک سیاحت کے دیوسائی جیسے جنت کے" (We are the owners of a land of tourism, like a paradise on earth) made me realize that our culture and natural beauty are not just elements of our identity but also our strength and pride. In both an economic and cultural sense, this sentence highlights the importance of our natural places, such the Deosai Plains, which are sometimes referred to as the "land of giants" or "paradise on earth."

Political Awareness
Gilgit-Baltistan, a region of immense geo strategic and geo economic significance, has been politically marginalized and excluded from meaningful representation since Pakistan's independence in 1947. Despite being an integral part of the country, the region has been denied provincial status and adequate political power, with its people having limited say in national affairs. The region has been governed through a colonial-era instrument like Frontier Crimes Regulations (FCR), the most recently Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order this also a political lollipop given to GB in the name of self-governance. This political neglect has resulted in widespread discontent and socio-economic disparities.
Given the disputed nature of Gilgit-Baltistan for last 7 decades, there seems to be a mounting concern of local people about the constitutional and political orphanage; but there is an absence of common political struggle from the people of the region. The ethnically diverse populace of the region has found it difficult to reconcile with each other and the burning issues like constitutional identity and political status of Gilgit Baltistan has therefore received lukewarm attention.
 Amidst the political desolation of Gilgit-Baltistan, the song "Ham Gilgit-Baltistan k Hain" emerged like a refreshing oasis in the desert, bringing hope and revitalizing the political consciousness of the region's people. This powerful song served as a awakening call for people of Gilgit-Baltistan and inspiring them to reclaim their rightful place in the nation's political landscape. As I listened to the song more and more, I realized that it was not just a song but a movement. It was a call to action, urging us to unite and fight for our rights. The lyrics "بھی رنگ رہے سو بَیص میں بھی کی جینا یوں پردیس میں بھی سو دروازے امکان کے ہیں دیکھو تو اپنے دیس میں بھی
". made me realize that why should we migrate to other areas for getting basic rights why don’t we ourselves fight for our rights and live in our motherland happily, no matter wherever we go our lives are incomplete without our motherland. This verse further highlights that if we look around our surrounding, we can find thousands of opportunities in Gilgit-Baltistan, the day we realize the importance of Gilgit-Baltistan and utilize its resources properly we don’t have to migrate to other parts of the world for employment, we can find opportunities on our doorsteps in Gilgit-Baltistan. But to achieve this we have to take concrete steps and fight and get our rights.
My observations from different online platforms also showed the greater the impact of the song within the digital realm.

Through this digital research I came to know the power of music as a medium for cultural expression and political mobilization within the context of Gilgit Baltistan. I saw many videos recently where content creators were using this song as background music to cover the historic protest in January, 2024 on the basic rights Gilgit-Baltistan where record number of people from all across Gilgit-Baltistan joined , through these videos these protest reached audience in Pakistan and all across world as the electronic media was not properly covering these protests.

So, Therefore, setting aside my personal beliefs and maintaining a balanced and neutral approach was quite challenging.
I Acknowledged my potential conflicts of interest and prioritized the people’s narrative in the research. This was the most critical ethical consideration throughout my ethnographic research. Balancing these dual roles required careful navigation to ensure that my insider knowledge enriched the research while maintaining the integrity and objectivity necessary for rigorous ethnographic inquiry.
